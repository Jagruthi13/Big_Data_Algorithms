# Big Data Algorithms

## Algorithms:
  1) Apriori Algorithm
  2) Naive Bayes Classification
  3) k-Nearest Neighbour Classification
  4) Decision Tree (will be implementing soon)

## Utilities:
  1) Minimum Maximum Normalization
  2) ZScore Normalization
  3) Binning by medians, means and boundaries
