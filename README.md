# Big_Data_Algorithms
Implementation of big data algorithms. Python scripts to solve big data problems.

Algorithms:
  1) Naive Bayes Classifier
  2) Decision Tree (will be implementing soon)

Utilities:
  1) Minimum Maximum Normalization
  2) ZScore Normalization
  3) Binning by medians, means and boundaries
